or

Go to the releases and grab an executable and add it to path.

### Usage
start memtech.
```$ mt```

Type in a a sentence or lines or paragraph you want to learn. Then press enter and it
will take you to a separate tab which shows the sentence you jsut wrote. Read it a
couple of times and when you feel slightly familiar to it. Press enter to go to the
second step where only the first letters of the words will be shown. Once you can read
through what you typed from only the first letters a few times you can say it
sequentially without looking at it.
